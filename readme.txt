== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why did you decide to make this plugin? =

I wanted to make a plugin and I thought it'd be a neat one.

= How did you decide which quotes to use? Why didn't you use 'insert quote here'? =

I picked the ones I did for recognizability, length and context. There were some I wanted to use that I didn't because it was part of a conversation and it would have been too long.
